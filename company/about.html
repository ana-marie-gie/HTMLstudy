      What’s the Best Dog Food for a Labrador Retriever? Finding the best dog
      food for your Lab’s age is far more important than it is for most other
      dogs. That’s because Labs are large breed dogs. Which is not a concern for
      adult Labs. However, unlike adults… Labrador puppies have an increased
      risk of acquiring a crippling form of canine hip dysplasia… unless they’re
      fed a diet that’s specially designed to be safe for large breed puppies.1
      For this reason… The Dog Food Advisor has selected the 10 brands listed
      below because they meet or exceed AAFCO2 nutrient profiles for adult Labs…
      and they’re made by some of the best companies in the industry. A few
      (where marked on the list) are safe for Labs of all ages. It’s important
      to remember… Some Lab puppies keep growing and aren’t ready to eat adult
      dog food until they reach 12 to 24 months of age.3 Got a puppy? See a list
      of our most recommended large breed puppy foods. We’ve intentionally
      included a few of our best grain-inclusive dog foods along with our best
      grain-free recipes to meet your feeding preferences. Buying tip: Some
      4-star recipes may actually be superior to 5-star brands when you also
      consider the companies that produce them… and their pricing.

      HISTORY DID YOU KNOW? BREED STANDARD OTHER BREEDS TO EXPLORE About the
      Labrador Retriever The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can,
      depending on the sex, stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the shoulder and
      weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat comes in yellow,
      black, and a luscious chocolate. The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with
      kindliness, and the thick, tapering “otter tail” seems to be forever
      signaling the breed’s innate eagerness. Labs are famously friendly. They
      are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, and they
      socialize well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don’t mistake his
      easygoing personality for low energy: The Lab is an enthusiastic athlete
      that requires lots of exercise, like swimming and marathon games of fetch,
      to keep physically and mentally fit. National Breed Clubs and Rescue Want

      NUTRITION GROOMING EXERCISE TRAINING HEALTH The Labrador Retriever should
      do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or
      home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet
      should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior). Some
      dogs are prone to getting overweight, so watch your dog’s calorie
      consumption and weight level. Treats can be an important aid in training,
      but giving too many can cause obesity. Learn about which human foods are
      safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any
      concerns about your dog’s weight or diet. Clean, fresh water should be
      available at all times. Labrador Retriever fetching a decoy in the water.

      Retriever is the traditional waterdog of Newfoundland, long employed as a
      duck retriever and fisherman’s mate. The breed began its steady climb to
      supreme popularity in the early 1800s, when Labs were spotted by English
      nobles visiting Canada. These sporting earls and lords returned to England
      with fine specimens of “Labrador dogs.” (Exactly how these dogs of
      Newfoundland became associated with Labrador is unclear, but the name
      stuck.) During the latter half of the 19th century, British breeders
      refined and standardized the breed. The physical and temperamental breed
      traits, so familiar today to millions of devotees around the world, recall
      the Lab’s original purpose. A short, dense, weather-resistant coat was
      preferred because during a Canadian winter longhaired retrievers would be
      encrusted with ice when coming out of the water. In its ancestral
      homeland, a Lab would be assigned to a fishing boat to retrieve the fish
      that came off the trawl. Accordingly, in addition to having natural
      instincts as a retriever, the dog required a coat suited to the icy waters
      of the North Atlantic. The Lab’s thick, tapering tail—an “otter tail,”
      it’s called— serves as a powerful rudder, constantly moving back and forth
      as the dog swims and aids the dog in turning. As for the breed’s
      characteristic temperament, it is as much a hallmark of the breed as the
      otter tail. “The ideal disposition is one of a kindly, outgoing, tractable
      nature; eager to please and nonagressive towards man or animal,” the breed
      standard says. “The Labrador has much that appeals to people; his gentle
      ways, intelligence and adaptability make him an ideal dog.” When defining
      a Lab’s primary attributes, the most important might be temperament since
      his utility depends on his disposition. “If a dog does not possess true
      breed temperament,” wrote a noted dog judge, “he is not a Labrador.” The
      Kennel Club (England) recognized the Lab in 1903, and the AKC registered
      its first dog of the breed in 1917. Labs topped AKC registrations for the
      first time in 1991 and has reigned as America’s favorite breed ever since.
      SHARE Did You Know? The Breed Standard GENERAL APPEARANCE The Labrador
      Retriever is a strongly built, medium-sized, short-coupled, dog possessing
      a sound, athletic, well-balanced conformation that enables it to function
      as a retrieving gun dog; the substance and soundness to hunt waterfowl or
      upland game for long hours under difficult conditions; the character and
      quality to win in the show ring; and the temperament to be a family
      companion. Physical features and mental characteristics should denote a
      dog bred to perform as an efficient Retriever of game with a stable
      temperament suitable for a variety of pursuits beyond the hunting
      environment. The most distinguishing characteristics of the Labrador
      Retriever are its short, dense, weather resistant coat; an “otter” tail; a
      clean-cut head with broad back skull and moderate stop; powerful jaws; and
      its “kind,” friendly eyes, expressing character, intelligence and good
      temperament. FULL BREED STANDARD 123456 Labrador Retriever illustration.
